Below are some common things done while using STM32 MCUs. This should be used as a quick reference.

## GPIO Setup

### Input

```c
//input configuration code goes here
```

### Output

```c
//output configuration code goes here
```

## Interrupt setup

### Timers

```c
//Timer interrupt configuration code goes here
```

### External

```c
//external interrupt configuration code goes here
```

## PWM

```c
//PWM configuration code goes here
```

## Communication

### Serial/TTL RS232

```c
//RS232 configuration code goes here
```

### I2C

```c
//I2C configuration code goes here
```
